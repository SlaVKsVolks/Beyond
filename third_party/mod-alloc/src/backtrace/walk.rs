//! Pure-Rust frame-pointer walk with hardening checks.
//!
//! Given an initial frame pointer (typically the result of
//! [`crate::backtrace::capture::current_fp`]) and the current
//! thread's stack bounds, walks up to 8 frames, returning the
//! captured return addresses.
//!
//! Safety strategy: every dereference is preceded by null,
//! alignment, in-range, and monotonicity checks (see
//! `.dev/DESIGN_v0.9.1.md` section 1). Any check failure stops
//! the walk and returns the frames captured so far. The walk is
//! also bounded to exactly 8 iterations as a final safety net.
