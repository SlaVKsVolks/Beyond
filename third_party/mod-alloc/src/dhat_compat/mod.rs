//! dhat-rs-shaped compatibility surface.
//!
//! Behind the `dhat-compat` cargo feature. Provides drop-in
//! replacements for `dhat::Alloc`, `dhat::Profiler`,
//! `dhat::ProfilerBuilder`, `dhat::HeapStats`, `dhat::AdHocStats`,
//! and `dhat::ad_hoc_event` so consumers migrating from dhat-rs
//! can swap allocator profilers with a one-line import change:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # #[cfg(feature = "dhat-compat")]
//! # mod swap_example {
//! use mod_alloc::dhat_compat as dhat;
//!
//! #[global_allocator]
//! static ALLOC: dhat::Alloc = dhat::Alloc;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     let _profiler = dhat::Profiler::new_heap();
//!     // ... work ...
//!     // _profiler drops here → writes dhat-heap.json
//! }
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! ## What is recorded when
//!
//! The counters behind [`HeapStats::get`] are always on. Call sites
//! (the per-site table written to `dhat-heap.json`) are recorded only
//! while at least one [`Profiler`] is alive, as in dhat-rs. Outside a
//! Profiler the allocator skips the frame walk, so counting-only use
//! (such as `dev-bench`'s allocation tracking) does not pay for it.
//!
//! ## Differences from dhat-rs
//!
//! Documented in `MIGRATING_FROM_DHAT.md`. Summary:
//!
//! - Backtrace depth is capped at 8 frames (Tier 2 walker limit);
//!   `ProfilerBuilder::trim_backtraces` is accepted for parity
//!   but silently clamps.
//! - Drop-time file-write errors are swallowed silently — same
//!   as dhat-rs's behaviour.
//! - Double-Profiler construction is a no-op rather than a panic
//!   (dhat-rs panics). Last writer wins on the JSON file.
//! - `dhat::assert!` / `assert_eq!` / `assert_ne!` macros are not
//!   yet shipped. Use `HeapStats::get()` directly in test
//!   assertions.

// Without a Profiler the counters behind `HeapStats::get()` stay exact
// and the frame walk is skipped. Hosting it as a `static` (rather than per-`Alloc`)
// is necessary because `Alloc` itself is a zero-sized type — it
// has no place to put atomic counters — and because dhat-rs's
// pattern uses literal `dhat::Alloc` values in `static` position
// without any constructor call.
