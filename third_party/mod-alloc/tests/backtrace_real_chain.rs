#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

//! Integration test: real-call-chain capture.
//!
//! Builds a chain of `#[inline(never)]` functions that ends in an
//! allocation. Asserts that the per-call-site report contains a
//! site with multiple distinct frames. We don't assert exact
//! frame counts or addresses (optimisation can still vary), only
//! that the walker captured *something* and that the aggregation
//! is non-empty.
//!
//! Requires `--features backtraces`. Without `-C
//! force-frame-pointers=yes` the captured trace may be very
//! shallow; the in-crate `.cargo/config.toml` enables that flag
//! for this crate's own builds.
